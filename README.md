# Point at which I had created a make file that deals with events taken from a particle detector such as STAR at LBNL. I have at this point set this 'make' file to plot transverse momentum relations, a 2d histogram with phi vs eta, a display of event counts vs delta phi which is cut into four trigger momentum ranges (and can then be cut into another four, instead based on associated momentum, in the separate draw file; here too gaussians can be fit to extra information about the spread of the jets). I recently included a "thermal background" into the data which would be present with real data. My next job is to find a way to remove the irrelevant background while leaving in parts that are related to the quark gluon plasma created in heavy ion collisions.
